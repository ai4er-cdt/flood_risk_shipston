# Shipston Flood Risk Project

## 1. Project Summary
#### Abstract 
The purpose of this project is to investigate whether we can establish the effectiveness of __natural flood management (NFM)__ [interventions](https://www.therrc.co.uk/sites/default/files/files/Guidance_training/NFM_Roadshow/May_West_Midlands/23may_westmids_shipstonstour_philwraggtomlavers.pdf) undertaken in the British town of [Shipston-on-Stour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipston-on-Stour) during 2017 to 2020 from publicly available meteorological data and private data from the river gauge in Shipston. 

Our analysis concludes that the available data (c.f. below for data sources) is not enough to confidently assess the effectiveness of 
recent NFM interventions in Shipston with [state-of-the-art rainfall-runoff LSTM models](https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/22/6005/2018/). We attribute this to three main factors:

- __Limited data on extreme events__: The period of 1990 to 2020 contains less than 10 floods in Shipston (ca. 7 independent events if we define a flood by a threshold of 3.4m river stage). This means that while there is ample data on the __average__ discharge in the catchment, there is only little information about the __extreme values__ of the river discharge. We see this reflected in the results of our model, as the model's predictions agree well with the ground truth on average dischage values in terms of [Nash-Sutcliff model efficiency (NSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash%E2%80%93Sutcliffe_model_efficiency_coefficient), but carry errors of about 20-30% for extreme events. 
- __Limited temporal resolution of available data__: All publicly available, past meteorological data from the [MetOffice](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/) and [NRFA](https://nrfa.ceh.ac.uk/) is available on a daily basis. Yet, historical data shows that floods in Shipston depend on processes on hourly timescales. Flooding in Shipston strongly depends on whether the peak flow through Shipston exceeds 3.4m (the height of the Shipston bridge arches) at any given time, which typically happens only for a few hours of a day, even during floods. NFM interventions help to __flatten the curve__ and distribute the peak flow across a wider time range by slowing upstream flow rates. Since leakage through NFMs likely occurs on timescales of hours as well (many NFMs are leaky dams), 
data with daily temporal resolution is likely not enough to confidently assess the effect of NFM interventions. In other words: NFM interventions might flatten the hourly flow without stronlgy affecting the daily total flow rate, such that the averaging over all hours in a day removes any information about the NFMs effectiveness.
- __Limited meteorological data availability__: While temperature, precipitation and river discharge data for 1990 to 2020 were readily available, we could not obtain other important meteorological data (notably humidity, windspeed, potential evapotranspiration or solar irradiation) data for this period for the Shipston catchment. This data is relevant to include information about the physical process of evapotranspiration into the model and its absence means that
our model predictions do not capture all relevant physical mechanisms. We assessed the effect of using only [precipitation and temperature instead of all meteorological data](https://github.com/ai4er-cdt/flood_risk_shipston/issues/17#issuecomment-721790841) via the publicly available [CAMELS-GB](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/8344e4f3-d2ea-44f5-8afa-86d2987543a9) dataset and found that we only loose about 2-4% in [NSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash%E2%80%93Sutcliffe_model_efficiency_coefficient) performance. While this means that evapotranspiration plays a less important role at high latitudes in Britain (Shipston: ~52Â° N), it is still a significant loss to drainage basins and should be taken into account from a hydrological point of view. 

Despite the limits on available data, our [runoff prediction model](https://github.com/ai4er-cdt/flood_risk_shipston/blob/master/README.md#2-runoff-prediction-model) was built in a general way such that it can directly use additional features (e.g. humidity, windspeed, etc.)
contained in the [CAMELS-GB](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/8344e4f3-d2ea-44f5-8afa-86d2987543a9) dataset when they become available for Shipston, and it can easily be extended to hourly instead of daily data. Therefore, the model developed in this project can be reused for the effectiveness assessment, once the limits on data-availability have been addressed. A detailed description of how to run the model on [CAMELS-GB](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/8344e4f3-d2ea-44f5-8afa-86d2987543a9) is given in section 2 of the readme. 

### 1.1 Approach

## 2. Runoff prediction model

This code trains an LSTM deep learning model to predict runoff using a dataset of 671 river basins around the UK.

Code features:

- Automatic real-time logging to the cloud with [wandb](https://wandb.ai/) of model loss, validation metrics, and a plot showing test results, using a publicly available dashboard.
- Full parallelisation across multiple GPUs and multiple nodes.
- Full command line interface to control all major model, dataset, and training options.
    - This uses [hydra](http://hydra.cc/), a framework that allows for composable and type-checked configuration objects created from yaml files.
- PyTorch Lightning model class, allowing for more modular code, less PyTorch boilerplate and easier customisation of the training process.
- Dataset class capable of handling an arbitrary number of river basins, with data from any date range and any number of features.
- Automatic saving of the best k checkpoints according to the validation metric.
- Fully type-hinted and well documented codebase.

### 2.1 Setup and model training

Before running the model, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to install all required packages (after installing conda). CUDA 10.1 is required to train on GPU with PyTorch 1.7.

The code is run from `main.py`, the only mandatory command line argument is `run_name`, a short string which describes the run. For example:

`python main.py run_name=test-run`.

An example of a more complex command:

`python main.py run_name=50-epochs-2005 gpus=4 dataset.basins_frac=0.5 dataset.train_test_split=2005 mode.epochs=50 model.dropout_rate=0.2`.


#### Full argument list:
- Main Options:
  - `run_name` - Mandatory string argument that describes the run.
  - `cuda` - Whether to use GPUs for training, defaults to `True`.
  - `gpus` - Number of GPUs to use, defaults to 1.
  - `precision` - Whether to use 32 bit or 16 bit floating points for the model. Warning: 16 bit is buggy. Defaults to 32.

Defaults to `{'timeseries' : ['precipitation', 'temperature', 'shortwave_rad', 'peti',  'humidity', 'windspeed']}` to use the 6 most useful timeseries features. Full list of features below. Better to change this in `src/configs/config.yaml` rather than the command line.
  - `dataset.seq_length` - Number of previous days of meterological data to use for one prediction, defaults to 365.
  - `dataset.train_test_split` - Split date to separate the data into the train and test sets, defaults to `'2010'` meaning 01-01-2020. You can pass a string in DD-MM-YYYY or YYYY formats.
  - `dataset.basins_frac` - Fraction of basins that will be combined to create the dataset, defaults to 0.1 meaning 10% since the full dataset requires roughly 100 GB of memory.
  - `dataset.shuffle` - Whether to shuffle the training dataset randomly, defaults to `True`.
  - `dataset.num_workers` - Number of subprocesses to use for data loading, defaults to 8.

  - `mode.log_steps` - How many gradient updates between each log point, defaults to 50.
  - `mode.date_range` - Custom date range for the training dataset to override the default range of 1970 to `dataset.train_test_split`, as a list of two strings (same formats as `dataset.train_test_split`).
  - `mode.mc_dropout` - Boolean that decides whether or not to use MC Dropout to plot output uncertainty. Defaults to `False`.
  - `mode.mc_dropout_iters` - Number of forward passes to use with MC dropout to get uncertainty, defaults to 20.

  - `model.dropout_rate` - Dropout probability, where the dropout is applied to the dense layer after the LSTM. Defaults to 0.0


### 2.2 Dataset and features

The dataset is [CAMELS-GB](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/8344e4f3-d2ea-44f5-8afa-86d2987543a9) - the first time it is run the code will automatically download and unzip the dataset to `src/data/CAMELS-GB/` using a Dropbox link.

Each basin has data from 8 different meterological timeseries, as well as many more static basin attributes that have a constant scalar value for the entire basin.

Below is a full list of features that can be included in the model. These are the only features that can be included in the `dataset.features` config option. Full descriptions of all these features can be found in the CAMELS-GB supplementary material.
